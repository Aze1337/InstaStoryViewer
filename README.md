InstaStoryViewer
--------
In this GitHub repository, I have developed an Instagram story viewer bot as a response to the numerous fake accounts/bots I've observed that mass-view stories for promotional purposes. Some services even charge $10/month per account to view a large number of stories daily.

I found it intriguing to explore Instagram's HTTP requests and APIs and determine the complexity of automating such a task. The provided code simulates the process of viewing a specific user's story. You can modify the code to include multi-threading and iterate through a comprehensive list of accounts.

In the future, I might develop and release a bot that scrapes a list of accounts, but I may also choose not to. This project is purely a hobby, and I do not generate any revenue from it.
